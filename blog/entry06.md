# Entry 6
##### X/X/XX

  My freedom project using three.js about a 3D open world parkour game has been completed, and I have presented my finished project during a class presentation and the expo. Firstly, I had to present my elevator pitch to the judges about my project where I showed the basic controls, the tool I used and specific challenges. I was nervous about my project because it wasn't exactly how I envisioned my end product. However, I felt proud of my project because I didn't follow the documentation word for word and actually wrote my own code and I was able to create and improvise my project to the things that I did learn throughout the year. Since I was at the end of the expo, I got the prepare myself for what I was going to say, which made things easier for me to prepare. During the explanation, I just pretended how I would present to a friend that didn't know about my project like the other people that were visiting my project and that made me relax a lot more. 

  During the presentation to the class, I felt way more confident than last year because I felt proud that I made something completely different from everyone else which I was able to explain to people that didn't use THREE.js. Although I did stutter a few times, they were unoticeable and the presentation went as smoothly as I would liked compared to last year. Some takeaways from the presentation was that I talk a little too fast as I felt I was speaking fast but after talking to some friends, they said I talked at an OK rate. This presentation also made me realise how important it is the practice. Practicing in my mind helped me ease myself and made my presentation way better than I normally would present. 

  This is the last part of the EDP (engineering design process) of communicating the result to show what I have created in the last school year. During this part, I developed the skills of organization because I had to come up with ways to express my information using the slides to show off my project in the best way possible. I also developed consideration because I had to think about how other people will use my project. I thought about how my project can be useful to others and how it is different from other projects.
