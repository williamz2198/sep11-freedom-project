# SEP11 Freedom Project
by William Zheng

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study THREE.js in order to help me make an open world parkour game. The game can be controlled using WASD and shift (to run) and the goal is to use the clouds to get to the top.

## Implications
##### PROS
* easy and quick way to open up a website and play
* It can teach/ show people how gravity and physics might work in a game
* Easy way to teach other people as a demonstration for javascript of a 3D game
* I can make people happier by playing
##### CONS
* graphics, physics and others that might not be well structured enough that might make the user fustruated
* might not particularly affect lives in a useful way other than entertainment
