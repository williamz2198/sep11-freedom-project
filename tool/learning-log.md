* I thought importing the tool was the most difficult
* I imported my tool into my terminal and animated 2 boxes(one cube and one prism) of different colors spinning in opposite ways
* Reading the tutorials made me confused about what the results were supposed to show but as I continued reading, I understood what each part was supposed to show
* When I tried to create a cube again by copying and pasting, it didn't work but then I realized I needed to create a new name for the prism
* next, I'm going to try to animate the boxes a different way and testing all the features the tool has
